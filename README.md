## Work Description

The objective of this activity was to strengthen programming skills and learn how to inspect the execution flow of a program through "breakpoints" and variable analysis.

### 1. FizzBuzz Kata
The classic FizzBuzz game has been implemented using **recursion** instead of conventional loops. The program evaluates numbers from 1 to 100, printing:
- "Fizz" for multiples of 3.
- "Buzz" for multiples of 5.
- "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both.

### 2. Tamagotchi Kata v1.0
A virtual pet simulator has been developed with **hunger**, **energy**, and **mood** attributes. The program changes the pet's emotional state (represented by emoticons like `:-)` or `ఠ_ఠ`) based on the actions of playing, eating, or sleeping.
